tumblr_scraper
==============

This python script currently grabs the images created by the tumblr user "posterology" in their series of Breaking Bad posters (one for every episode). They are downloaded and named with the alt-text of each image, and it removes any special accent characters such as 'Ã©' and replaces it with the equivalent 'e'.

## To Modify

Change line 4 to contain whatever pages you want and line 6 to be the webpage you want. It also only currently downloads jpgs, this can also be changed on line 14.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* Beautiful Soup 4

## To Run
`python tumblr_scraper.py` will download all the images in the current directory.
